<h1>Flexbox</h1>

<h3>What can you do with a flex layout?</h3>

<p>Flex layouts have the following features, which you will be able to explore in this guide.</p>

<ul>
	<li>They can display as a row, or a column.</li>
	<li>They can display as a row, or a column.</li>
	<li>They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.</li>
	<li>Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.</li>
	<li>Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.</li>
	<li>Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.</li>
	<li>The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.</li>

<h3>The main axis and the cross axis</h3>

<p>The key to understanding flexbox is to understand the concept of a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Controlling the direction of items</h3>

<p>Even if you don't add a flex-direction property, the items display as a row because the initial value of flex-direction is row. If you want a row then you don't need to add the property. To change the direction, add the property and one of the four values:</p>

<ul>
	<li>row: the items lay out as a row.</li>
	<li>row-reverse: the items lay out as a row from the end of the flex container.</li>
	<li>column: the items lay out as a column.</li>
	<li>column-reverse : the items lay out as a column from the end of the flex container.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing modes and direction</h3>
<p>Flex items lay out as a row by default. A row runs in the direction that sentences flow in your writing mode and script direction. Therefore the way flex items behave by default is linked to the writing mode of the document.</p>
<p>Each axis has a start and an end. The start of the main axis is referred to as main-start. So our flex items initially line up from main-start. The end of that axis is main-end. The start of the cross axis is cross-start and the end cross-end.</p>

<h3>Wrapping flex items</h3>

<p>The initial value of the flex-wrap property is nowrap. This means that if there is not enough space in the container the items will overflow.</p>

<p>When a flex container wraps it creates multiple flex lines. In terms of space distribution, each line acts like a new flex container. Therefore if you are wrapping rows, it is not possible to get something in row 2 to line up with something above it in row 1. This is what is meant by flexbox being one-dimensional. You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as we can do in grid.</p>

<h3>Controlling space inside flex items</h3>

<p>Assuming our container has more space than is needed to display the items, the items line up at the start and do not grow to fill the space. They stop growing at their max-content size. This is because the initial value of the flex- properties is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>flex-grow: 0: items do not grow.</li>
	<li>flex-shrink: 1: items can shrink smaller than their flex-basis.</li>
	<li>flex-basis: auto: items have a base size of auto.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be represented by a keyword value of flex: initial. The flex shorthand property, or the longhands of flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis are applied to the children of the flex container.</p>

<h3>Reordering flex items</h3>

<p>Items in your flex container can be reordered using the order property. Items are laid out in the direction dictated by flex-direction, lowest values first. If more than one item has the same value it will be displayed with the other items with that value.</p>

<h3>Flexbox alignment overview</h3>

<p>Flexbox brought with it a set of properties for aligning items and distributing space between items. These properties were so useful they have since been moved into their own specification, you'll encounter them in Grid Layout too. Here you can find out how they work when you are using flexbox.</p>

<p>The set of properties can be placed into two groups. Properties for space distribution, and properties for alignment. The properties which distribute space are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>justify-content: space distribution on the main axis.</li>
	<li>align-content: space distribution on the cross axis.</li>
	<li>place-content: a shorthand for setting both of the above properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The properties used for alignment in flexbox:</p>
<ul>
	<li>align-self: aligns a single item on the cross axis.</li>
	<li>align-items: aligns all of the items as a group on the cross axis.</li>
</ul>

<strong>If you are working on the main axis then the properties begin with justify-. On the cross axis they begin with align-.</strong>

<h3>Distributing space between flex lines </h3>

<p>With a wrapped flex container you might have space to distribute on the cross axis. In this case you can use the align-content property with the same values as justify-content. Unlike justify-content which aligns items to flex-start by default, the initial value of align-content is stretch. Add the property align-content to the flex container to change that default behavior.</p>

<h3>Why is there no justify-self in flexbox? </h3>

<p>In grid layout the justify-self and justify-items properties work on the inline axis to do alignment of items on that axis within their grid area. Due to the way that flex layouts treat items as a group, these properties are not implemented in a flex context.</p>

<h3>How to center an item vertically and horizontally</h3>

<p>The alignment properties can be used to center an item inside another box. The justify-content property aligns the item on the main axis, which is row. The align-items property on the cross axis.</p>
